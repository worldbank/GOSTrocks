WorldPop aims to meet these needs through the provision of detailed and open access spatial demographic datasets built using transparent approaches. The Scientific Data WorldPop collection brings together descriptor papers on these datasets and is introduced here. SN  - 2052-4463 https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2017.4"},
